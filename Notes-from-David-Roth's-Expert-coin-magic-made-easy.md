# Notes from David Roth's Expert coin magic made easy  
  
  
## Holds  
### Classic palm  
The coin is held in the middle of the palm by contracting lower thumb muscles.   
To place it in position either hold on open hand and contract muscles then rotate. Another option is to put oin ring and middle finger and press it into hand while index and thumb are touching (to prevent thumb shooting backwards).  
Try to make it look natural and keep knuckles down. You can try puting the hand flat on the table while holding the coin.  
### Finger Palm  
Put coin on ring and middle finger and old with ring finger  
### Thumb palm  
Hold the coin with index, middle and thumb and use middle and index to slide it across thumb to the hand then simply hold with thumb.  
  
  
## Vanishing a coin  
  
### Finger palm vanish (Shuttle pass)  
simply pretend to dump the coin into other hand but retain with finger Palm  
### French drop  
Hold coin firh middle, index and thumb (perpendicular) above the hand and pretend to take it with fingertips of other hand. Simply drop while the other hand covers view and retain in finger palm  
  
## Producing a coin  
### The L' Masque load  
Hold a coin in classic palm, show other hand empty and make a loose fist. Then make a magic gesture over the fist and drop a coin inside between index and thumb while rotating it to make magical gesture on the other side as well  
### The Vernon load  
Hold a coin in thumb palm, make a loose fist with other, then drop the coin between palm and fingers while stroking the fingers lengthwise. (Drop it on the first pass and stroke away from the fist)  
  
  
### Clasic and finger palm production  
Drop to finger rest position and slide it out of finger using a thumb  
### Thumb palm coin production  
Same as in classic palm, or hold it with middle and  index and simply extend them
