# [Spiral-Cutting A T-Shirt](https://soapbubble.fandom.com/wiki/Spiral-Cutting_A_T-Shirt)  
Ideally get an (unused) T-shirts have no side seams.   
## Cutting  
  
1. Lay out the t-shirt on the cutting mat.

2. Slice just below the arm and just above the hem. This will leave you with a seamless tube of jersey fabric.

3. Fold the t-shirt lengthwise (so that the tube is still open at the bottom and top) but leave a 'spine' at the side that is not doubled up. If your cutter is sharp (it probably is), fold again lengthwise leaving the 'spine' undoubled.

4. Slice horizontally the folded-over portion of the t-shirt creating strips. DO NOT slice on the 'spine' portion.

5. When you have cut all the strips, unfold the t-shirt. It should like this:

6. Open up the t-shirt so that the uncut "spine" is centered. If you are going to use the rotary cutter, put something (a book, the cutting mat, a piece of cardboard, etc) under the spine so that you do not cut through to the other side. You might want to use scissors for this part.

7. Cut diagonally as indicated by the red lines. These cuts will create a single continuous strip.

7. The T-Shirt Yarn before stretching

8. The T-Shirt Yarn as it appears after stretching. Note how it has become narrower due to the curling that takes place when t-shirt yarn is stretched.  
9. Wind the t-shirt yarn onto a spool for storage. The picture shows t-shirt yarn on a homemade spool cut from heavy cardboard.  
  
## Using T-Shirt Strips  
  
Once you have cut the strips or loop (a t-shirt cross-section makes a nice unknotted continuous loop), you should pull to stretch it. This will encourage its natural tendency to roll up into a tubular shape.  
  
It appears that lightweight 100% cotton is the best material. It is reported that any amount of polyester in the material detracts from its effectiveness as a bubble wick. Lightweight t-shirts seem to work better than heavier weight t-shirts.  
  
The tubular nature of these strips may be advantageous for using it to wrap around other wick material if, for instance, you want a top-string that has more holding capacity than the side strings which seems like it would be advantageous for making giant bubbles although the author has not yet performed experiments to confirm this.
