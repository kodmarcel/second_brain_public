## Sigh breathing  
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eog-DxgW_F8)  
- better stress reduction and sleep improvement than meditation! Meditation has better improvement on memory however.  
- 5 minutes a day gave 24h positive effects: reduced rest heart rate, better sleep, improved mood  
- cyclic sigh had best results  
    - inhale through the nose as much as possible  
    - sharp inhale on top of that to maximally inflate lungs also through the nose  
        - this expands the collapsed avioli  
    - long exhale through the mouth  
 - even one cycle during the day to reduce level of stress. fastest way to reintroduce calm and get balance
