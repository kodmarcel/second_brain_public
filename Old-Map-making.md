# How did Europeans make such incredibly accurate maps of whole continents without any kind of aerial observation as to their shapes?  
Triangles. Lots and lots of triangles.  
  
The military need maps, so they employed map makers. The UK’s mapping agency is still known as the Ordnance Survey today.  
  
The basic technique is simple geometry.  
  
Identify three points 1- 2–3. Hilltops or tall buildings are good.  
  
Now measure the straight line between two of the points- your baseline- and measure all the angles. Yes, get out the ruler (actually a [surveyor’s chain](./surveyor%E2%80%99s-chain.md)) and physically measure it. The longer and more precise your baseline measurement, the better.  
  
This allows you to calculate all the lengths.  
  
Now construct another triangle using two of the same points i.e 1–2–4, and calculate the lengths.  
  
Now do 1–2–5, and so on. This gives you a basic grid, and you can measure from your grid points to points inside the grid.  
  
  
and you get to this.  
  
  
If you look at this survey of India  
  
  
You can see the chains of triangles  
  
In some places, there weren’t good high points to use, so they were built to order.  
  
  
George Everest (pronouced “Eevrist”) was in charge of that survey of India. When it found a very tall mountain, it was named after him.
