# [Adjustable Grip Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/adjustable-grip-hitch-knot)  
*! Never tie close to a tree or large object – the knot may release.*  
## How to tie  
Pass the working end around the object. Wrap the end twice around the standing end.

## Some info  
    
**Origin:** The Adjustable Grip Hitch is a Friction Knot that is readily adjusted when not loaded.  
    
**Uses:** The Adjustable Grip Hitch is useful for tensioning a line such as a tent ridgeline or a guy-line. When the knot is adjusted, by sliding it along the standing end, it may require tightening with a pull on the leg that forms the knot.  
    
**Caution:** The Adjustable Grip Hitch should be avoided for critical applications such as climbing since it may slip when shock loaded.  
    
**Variations:** This knot can be tied using a loop for the final step (“slipped”); then a pull on the end releases it. In slippery rope for more security, wrap the end around the standing end three times before completing the knot.  
    
**Advantages:** The Adjustable Grip Hitch grips well and some writers claim it is easier to learn and remember than other friction knots.  
    
**Disadvantages:** Until completed the knot cannot _“take the load”_. By contrast, the [Midshipman’s Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans-hitch-knot) initially forms an [Awning Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans-hitch-knot#awning) that will take load temporarily. This can be useful when setting tent guy lines or taking the initial load of a mooring line.
