## Design for automatcher database
- Database consist of parts:
  - Sources_database
    - all data that is in the system and we are going to match against
    - Tables:
      - source_ids: - connects source ids from different sources to a unified id in our database
      - titles: - connects multiple title akas to our id
      - people: - assigns a person_id to each name
      - directors: - maps ids to person_id for directors
      - release_dates: - maps different release_dates from different sources to id
      - release_years: - maps different release_years from different sources to id
      - runtimes: - maps different runtime from different sources to id
      - genres: - maps different genres from different sources to id
  - Search_inputs:
    - insert of data we have that we want matched against the database
    - Tables:
      - search_input_data: contains all information that we have can only one of per an item (runtime, release_years and any other data we want to keep mapped) Each row is also assigned an input_id
        - input_index, type, release_year, runtime_minutes
      - search_input_titles: maps all different titles we got to the input_id
        - input_index, title
      - search_input_directors: maps all the directors we got to ht input_id
        - input_index, director
      - search_output: maps input_id to all potential ids that we matched to and also includes the score and all matching information
        - input_index, id, match_title, title_score, match_type, match_director, director_score, match_release_year, match_runtime, score
 

## Automatcher data input flow design
1. insert imdb data into sources database
2. automach tvdb data to it and insert it alongside to expand the database
   
## Automatching flow
Data to be matched is named search_input_data
1. Preprocess data to get correct structure and format
2. Insert data into search_input_data, search_input_titles, search_input_directors
   1. first delete data from those tables and drop the whole search_input_data table so it can be recreated with all needed columns (the ones we want to keep mapped to matched data)
3. Use one of the methods (exact, partial, metaphone, fuzzy, directors) to get potential match ids and populate search_output_data with them along with all the metadata
    - for excact we can just use join on normalized title column
    - not sure we really need partial and cannot really do it in the db. will leave it out for now
    - for director just use join on normalized alphabetically sorted director name (so we fix problem when it is turned)
    - for metaphone we can use metaphone column and then do fuzzy matching to determine title_score and use as cutoff.
    - for fuzzy we need to do it outside of the database for now but the index and vectorizer can be stored in the database.
    - To get metadata just make a join
4. score potential matches
    - just copmpare input data and output data for matches and then assign a score
5. repeat 3 and 4 with different methods for input_ids that do not have a match rating of 4 or 5
