- do not let you kids do anything that makes you dislike them  
- first you have to teach them what no means  
- must not let them get you mad  
- when they do not listen have them take a timeout  
- when you want to change something reward them:  
  - example:  
    - buy 10 cheap gifts and wrap them then put them in a visible and unreachable spot for them  
    - tell them they will get one when they do what you ask from them
