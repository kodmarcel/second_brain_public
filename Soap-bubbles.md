## Conditions  
Weather/environmental conditions have a huge impact on how long bubbles last and how large you can make them. Even with great bubble juice and a great wand, your bubbles might be limited by the conditions. Cool temperatures with good humidity are necessary for some of the really giant bubbles that you see on the wiki. But, with good juice and a good "loop", you can make some nice bubbles even in hot or dry or hot/dry weather as long as you adjust your expectations. [Read more](https://soapbubble.fandom.com/wiki/Ideal_Conditions "Ideal Conditions") about the conditions that affect bubbling.
