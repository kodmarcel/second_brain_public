# [Soap bubbles](Soap-bubbles.md) Summary  
## [Guar mix](./Guar-mix.md)  
### Ingridients for a little over 1 liter:  
- Water 1l  
- dishwashing liquid (Jar extra+) 40-65ml (3 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon = 65ml - 1:20)    
- guar gum 0.5-3g (1.5g = 1/4 teaspoon ~ 0.3ml)  
- baking powder 2g (1/2 teaspoon - 2.5ml)  
- slurry (gliceryn/isopropyl alcohol)  
### Procedure  
[Video](https://youtu.be/17lx_TzahpE)  
* Mix guar gum with slurry - use enough slurry to have a disolve all gum and to make it pourable  
* mix it well with water  
* add detergent and baking powder  
* mix gently to prevent foam  
  
Guar gum might be hard to get in Slovenia. I bougt it from [online store](https://www.natural-loti.si/izdelek/guar-gumi-prah/) and took the biggest package they had (250g).  
  
## [Wands](./Wands.md)  
### Summary  
Tri string wand is simply 2 sticks with a rope between them so that it forms a triangle like on the image bellow:  
  
It is best to use cotton for the rope. In a pinch chopsticks can be used for the handles and an old cotton shirt can be cut to make yarn.    
[Spiral cutting technique to get the most yarn out of the shirt](./Spiral-cutting-technique-to-get-the-most-yarn-out-of-the-shirt.md)  
Cotton shoelace or cooking twine can also be used.  
  
Tie the rope between sticks so that the bottom portion is 2 times as long as the top portion. Optionally also add some weight to the bottom portion (washer) to help prevent tangling.

### Using A Tri-String  
  
The basic technique for using a tri-string wand is simple.  
  
-   If there is wind, stand with the wind at your back.  
-   Hold the wand tips together and dip the loop into the dipping container. Make sure the loop is completely saturated with bubble solution.  
-   Keeping the wand tips together raise the loop out of the containerÂ **keeping the tips together** (very important).  
-   Raise your arms (with the wand tips still together) and spread them. Generally, you want to raise the wand tips above shoulder or head level before starting to spread the wand.  
-   If there is no wind, walk backwards (being careful not to bump into anything).  
-   Bring the wand tips together to close the bubble. You may be able to make multiple bubbles by opening and closing the wand repeatedly.  
  
If the wind is brisk, keep the tips together and start walking with the wind before you start spreading the wand tips. This reduces the wind speed relative to the bubble.  
  
When you raise the wand out of the dipping container, you may want to experiment if the wand works best right away or if it is best to let excess solution drain before trying to make a bubble. It is often, but not always, beneficial to let the excess drain.  
  
Bubbles work best in humid conditions.  
  
  
## Conditions  
Weather/environmental conditions have a huge impact on how long bubbles last and how large you can make them. Even with great bubble juice and a great wand, your bubbles might be limited by the conditions. Cool temperatures with good humidity are necessary for some of the really giant bubbles that you see on the wiki. But, with good juice and a good "loop", you can make some nice bubbles even in hot or dry or hot/dry weather as long as you adjust your expectations.
