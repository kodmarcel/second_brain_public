# Interesting psychology facts  
  
## Cathedral effect  
There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely  
  
## Relationship  
A healthy relationship has 1 bad interaction for every 4-11 good ones.  
  
## Happines vs unhappines  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
One of the funny things about diet, nutrition,exercise, sleep, they don't actually bring happiness, but they do lower unhappiness, which can be your problem.  
  
Happiness on one side of the brain, unhappiness on the other.  
  
The left side of the face, which is controlled by the right side of the brain, is more active when we're feeling negative emotions.  
  
  
## Arrival fallacy  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
  
This is the real riddle of happiness.  
  
You, I, everybody, Mother Nature teaches us that to get satisfaction and keep it you need to have more.  
That's the wrong model.  
  
==**Your real satisfaction is all the things you have divided by all the things that you want.**==  
  
Now you can try to increase your satisfaction permanently by having more, or you can work on the denominator of haves divided by wants.  
You can work on wanting less.  
That turns out to be the right formula.  
  
## Gratitude

## What is happines  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
Happiness is actually a combination of three identifiable things that we all need.  
==Well, your happiness is enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose.==  
  
Enjoyment is not just pleasure, it's pleasure with consciousness. It's using your prefrontal cortex.  
Satisfaction is the joy that you get from a job well done. It's your reward for striving, for working, for even suffering.  
Purpose, what's that? Well, that's really a question of finding coherence in your life, finding goals in your life, finding significance in your life. If you have those three things, you have happiness.  
  
## How to find purpose  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
If you're feeling like life doesn't have enough purpose,that life doesn't have enough meaning, answer the following two questions:  
  
why am I alive, and for what would I be willing to die?  
  
  
  
## How does age affect happiness?

Now most people watching me are optimists. Most people think they're gonna be happier at 38 than they were at 28, and the reason is because these have these goals and they think that they're gonna meet their goals.  
  
Most people think they're gonna get happier as they get older, and it's gonna reach a max point, and then it's gonna head back down again.  
  
The truth is exactly the opposite. Most people, on average, they get a slight diminution of their happiness from their early 20s until their late 40s or early 50s, but it's like eight to seven on a 1 to 10 scale.  
  
This is not a huge problem. Noticeable but not horrible. Then in your early 50s it turns around and you start back up again, and almost everybody actually gets increasing happiness from their early 50s until about 70, except two groups: people who have unremediated mental illness and people who have untreated substance use disorders.  
  
  
## Nothing lasts  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
Here's what you learn after 50:  
nothing lasts and it doesn't matter.  
There's a thing that all biologists talk about,  
which is homeostasis,  
the tendency of every biological process  
to go back to its equilibrium.  
  
Well, it works emotionally as well.  
Your anger, your sadness, your disgust, your fear, your joy,  
your interest, those things don't last for good and for bad.  
Your heart is broken? It won't last.  
When you figure that out, this is power,  
and if you harness that, every year's better than the last.  
Or it can be.  
  
  
## Afraid of dying  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
There's a meditation that the Theravada Buddhists do. If you go to a monastery, a Buddhist monastery, in the southern tier of Asia, especially East Asia, Thailand or Vietnam or Myanmar, you'll find pictures of corpses in various states of decay and that the monks have to ponder and they have to say, "That is me and that is me."  
  
What are they doing?  
They're doing what's called the maranasati death meditation.  
  
Walk yourself through that. Why? Because you're gonna accustom yourself to that sort of surreal experience of your own death as you see it.  
  
How do I transcend my mortal anguish?  
By leaning into my mortal anguish.  
You beat fear by experiencing the fear and making it ordinary, and it will no longer be a ghost and it will no longer be a problem.  
  
## Mindfulness  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
Mindfulness is hard because we're time travelers.  
You're thinking about the past.  
You're thinking about the future.  
The average person, by the way, spends 30 to 50% of their time thinking about the future. That's unbelievable.  
  
You're not here now. Think about how much you do that, by the way. You go on vacation, you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna make some memories, so I'm gonna take a picture"  
  
You're thinking about now as if it were the past in the future when you're looking back on the present.  
That's unbelievable time travel.  
We do it all the time.  
  
Here's the problem.  
You missed your life. You missed it.  
You know, the great Vietnamese Buddhist monk  
Thich Nhat Hahn, y'all have to read "The Miracle of Mindfulness" 'cause it starts off with him describing what it's like to wash the dishes. I'm washing the dishes, and I'm conscious of washing the dishes because if I don't think about washing the dishes I will not be present in the act of washing the dishes.   
That means working on being a mindful person. Maybe it's with meditation, maybe it's with prayer, maybe it's with therapy, and sitting with your hands folded on your lap looking out the window of the train saying, "I am sitting on the train right now "because I don't wanna miss my life."  
  
  
## Wisdom  
[video](https://youtu.be/vTmixSgeOI0)  
Different forms of intelligence, find that we have a thing called fluid intelligence early on.   
  
In our 20s and 30s, the ability to focus, to innovate, to solve problems, to think quickly.  
  
People tend to peak in knowledge professions, at their ability to solve problems, to innovate, to focus, working memory in their late 30s.  
  
But there's another curve behind it called crystallized intelligence,  
  
which increases through your 40s and 50s and 60s and stays high in your 70s and 80s.  
  
It's the wisdom curve. The essence of wisdom is teaching, is mentoring.  
It's leading teams. It's recognizing patterns. It's understanding what things really mean and using that information in service of other people.  
  
And it gets better, and if you choose to cultivate it, it can make your life as happy as it could possibly be as you get older. That's not only the consolation of age, that's the promise of wisdom.  
Well, it looks like that's all we've got for today.
